# Crystal-Ritual
A design-driven ritual using crystals as physical anchors for focus and emotional awareness.
A ritual is not a belief.
It is a moment of alignment.

Each Crystal Ritual begins with intention.
Not to wish for change, but to notice it.

Hold the crystal.
Feel its weight, its temperature, its quiet resistance.
This is matter that has waited millions of years to arrive in your hands.

Breathe slowly.
Name what you are carrying.
Not what you want to fix, but what you are ready to face.

The crystal does not act for you.
It reflects, stabilizes, and remembers.

Wear it not as protection,
but as a reminder
that clarity is something you practice,
not something you receive.

This is your ritual.
Simple. Repeatable. Yours.
