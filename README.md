# Crystal-Ritual
A design-driven ritual using crystals as physical anchors for focus and emotional awareness.
This mini-app helps users become aware of their emotional states.

Crystals are used as physical anchors for focus, emotional awareness, and gentle recalibration.
Through simple, repeatable crystal resonance and charging rituals,
the app guides users back to a state of inherent wholeness.

The ritual does not attempt to fix the user.
It supports observation, stabilization, and reconnection with one’s inner state.
